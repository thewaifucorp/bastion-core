# check-scope-and-scrub.sh — Loop 3-D (docs/revamp/C3-cloud-ready-design.md),
# acceptance criterion 5 + decision #18 (docs/revamp/BACKLOG.md).
#
# Two independent guards, run together because both gate what may exist in
# this PUBLIC repo:
#
#   1. Cloud-concept scope guard — the Core must never gain a billing,
#      marketplace, tenancy, or control-plane SYMBOL (a `struct`/`enum`/
#      `trait`/`fn`/`mod`/`const`/`static`/`type` DECLARATION, not a prose
#      mention). Design docs are explicitly allowed to name these concepts
#      when documenting them as OUT OF SCOPE (e.g. C3-cloud-ready-design.md's
#      own "Fora de escopo" section) — this guard only scans compiled `.rs`
#      code (src/, crates/*/src/, tests/, examples/*/src/), never docs/.
#      Comment-only lines (`//`, `///`, `//!`) are excluded — a code comment
#      explaining why the kernel does NOT have a concept (this script's own
#      doc comments included) is not a violation.
#
#   2. Corporate-name scrub guard (decision #18) — a small, deliberately
#      short, low-collision blocklist of proprietary names scrubbed from
#      this repo's public tip on 2026-06-30. Scans EVERY tracked file (not
#      just code) — a leaked name in a doc, a comment, or a config file is
#      equally a leak. `Bastion Cloud` is NOT on this list — it stays
#      (decision: only the closed-source corporate/product names leave).
#
# Exit 0 on success, exit 1 on any violation (prints every violation found).
# Implemented as a single Python pass (like scripts/dump-public-api.sh) —
# a shell line-by-line loop over every tracked file is both slow and fragile
# for this repo's size.
